            &ldquo; My decision to become a doctor was driven largely by values
            instilled in me by my faith and my family. The idea of being a part
            of a profession focused on helping others regardless of
            circumstance, focused on facilitating people leading healthier and
            therefore happier lives. I canâ€™t imagine a more fulfilling
